Tools created in an attempt to port custom cars from Stunts 1.1 on DOS to 4D Sports Driving 1.2 on Amiga

- Source is available in .NET7
- Use at your own risk and provided with no warranty! Make a backup of your 4D Sports Driving install.
- There are a LOT of custom cars available for Stunts for DOS, we can *partly* convert to Amiga. [Mark Ceccato's page](https://www.markceccato.com/) has a lot of them.
- Download Stunts_2_Amiga.exe from the BIN folder into your Stunts folder ("data" if using WHDLoad). May need to have .NET installed to run the executable.
- Download custom cars into the same folder.
- Run Stunts_2_Amiga.exe to convert all of the custom cars.
- You need to select the dashboard from one of the existing cars, the dashboard format hasn't (yet) been reverse engineered for Amiga.
- The conversion of the custom cars may be glitchy and cause crashes, I've noticed this particularly with WHDLoad when giving the opponent a custom car. (Haven't had any crashes using the regular "Stunts" exe.)
